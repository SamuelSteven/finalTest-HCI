# Final Test Human and Computer Interaction

This is a final test from Human Computer and Interaction Course. This project is a individual project. This project asked me to make an clinic application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. This project creates an "Online Booking" at the clinic for patients that can be accessed via mobile phones, where the following functions are available:

-	Registration page for new patients
-	Registration / booking for registered patients, confirmation of queue numbers as well as notification of estimates / suggestions for patient arrival hours. Patients can also choose which unit to book for.
-	The application will notify the number of the current patient who is being examined according to the unit booked.
